# Library-App-Buy-Preview
Building a book library app and you want to load a huge data of books then for adding this feature.
Have to use a simple API which is provided by Google, and of course, itâ€™s free. 
In this repository, we will take a look at the implementation of this API in our Android App. 
Building a simple application in which we will be searching different types of books and we will get to see the list of books related to that topic in our RecyclerView. 
For searching these books we will be using a free API provided by Google which holds a huge collection of books. 
Note that we are going to implement this project using the Java language.
